I want to build a tabbar
  a) I could build a tabs using WEUI, want to figure out how to get the text in the middle

BUG: navbar is overlapping with the tab bar. 
  a) build a component that contains both the navbar and the tabbar
  b) add extra space to the tabbar on top by calculating the height of the tabbar
  c) try to figure out how to get the tabbar below the navbar
